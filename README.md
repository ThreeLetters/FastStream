# FastStream - Not finished yet
A revamped version of the original FastStream prototype - Never have videos buffer again.

## What is the prototype?

The prototype is already complete and working, and it is a chrome extension. It will automatically replace videos with the FastStream client, and will speed up the download while making sure it never buffers.

## Why the remake?

The prototype is a prototype and is messy code that I wrote when I had the flu. I am re-factoring it to make it better
